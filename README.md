## Overview
**CrackMe** is a simple password-cracking challenge built with Python and `tkinter`. It provides a basic user interface where you must guess the correct password to proceed. The program mimics a reverse engineering exercise where you need to figure out the correct password to unlock the application.

This project is designed for educational purposes, specifically for those practicing password cracking and reverse engineering techniques.

## Features
- **Password Prompt**: The user is asked to enter a password.
- **Limited Attempts**: The user has 3 attempts to enter the correct password.
- **Windowed GUI**: A clean user interface.
- **Success/Failure**: If the correct password is entered, a success message is shown. If the wrong password is entered, an error message appears, and the attempts counter decreases.
- **Game Over**: After 3 incorrect attempts, the program will display a "Game Over" message and close.

## Installation
